# Discord Bot Setup Guide

## Common Problems and Fixes

### Problem 1: "Used disallowed intents" Error
Your bot is failing to connect because it's requesting intents that aren't properly configured in Discord Developer Portal.

**üîß IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED:** Follow these steps to configure intents in Discord Developer Portal:

1. **Go to Discord Developer Portal**: https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. **Select your application** (CRAWJU Buy Bot)
3. **Click "Bot" in the left sidebar**
4. **Scroll down to "Privileged Gateway Intents"**
5. **DISABLE ALL privileged intents**:
   - ‚ùå Presence Intent (should be OFF)
   - ‚ùå Server Members Intent (should be OFF) 
   - ‚ùå Message Content Intent (should be OFF)
6. **Click "Save Changes"**
7. **Redeploy your Railway application**

**Note:** This bot only needs basic Guild access to send notifications. No privileged intents are required.

### Problem 2: "Missing Access" Error  
Your bot lacks the necessary permissions to send messages to your Discord channel.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Check Bot Permissions in Discord Server

1. **Open Discord** and go to your server
2. **Right-click your bot** in the member list
3. **Click "Manage"** ‚Üí **"Permissions"**
4. **Ensure these permissions are enabled:**
   - ‚úÖ View Channels
   - ‚úÖ Send Messages
   - ‚úÖ Embed Links
   - ‚úÖ Attach Files
   - ‚úÖ Read Message History

### 2. Check Channel-Specific Permissions

1. **Go to the target channel** (ID: `1411385603961913344`)
2. **Click the gear icon** next to the channel name ‚Üí **"Permissions"**
3. **Click the "+" button** to add your bot specifically
4. **Select your bot** and ensure these permissions are **ALLOWED** (green):
   - ‚úÖ View Channel
   - ‚úÖ Send Messages
   - ‚úÖ Embed Links
   - ‚úÖ Attach Files

### 3. Re-invite Bot (if necessary)

If the above doesn't work, you may need to re-invite your bot with proper permissions:

1. **Go to Discord Developer Portal**: https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. **Select your application** ‚Üí **"OAuth2"** ‚Üí **"URL Generator"**
3. **Select scopes**: `bot`
4. **Select bot permissions**:
   - View Channels
   - Send Messages
   - Embed Links
   - Attach Files
   - Read Message History
5. **Copy the generated URL** and open it in your browser
6. **Re-invite the bot** to your server

### 4. Verify Bot Token

If you're still getting errors, verify that:
- Your `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable is correct
- The bot hasn't been regenerated in Discord Developer Portal
- The bot is still a member of your server

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your Railway deployment:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=1411385603961913344
BLOCKFROST_API_KEY=your_blockfrost_key
```

## Testing the Fix

After making these changes:
1. **Redeploy your Railway app**
2. **Check the logs** - you should see:
   ```
   üîç Permission check results:
   - View Channel: ‚úÖ
   - Send Messages: ‚úÖ
   - Embed Links: ‚úÖ
   - Attach Files: ‚úÖ
   ‚úÖ Startup message sent successfully
   ```

## Common Issues

### "Channel not found"
- Double-check the channel ID: `1411385603961913344`
- Ensure the bot is in the same server as the channel
- Make sure the channel exists and isn't deleted

### "Missing Permissions" 
- Follow the permission setup steps above
- Some servers have role hierarchies - make sure the bot's role is high enough

### "Bot was removed"
- The bot might have been kicked from the server
- Re-invite using the OAuth2 URL with proper permissions

## Advanced: Discord Bot Intents (For Developers)

If you need to modify the bot's capabilities in the future, you may need to adjust intents:

### Current Intents (Minimal for notification bot):
```javascript
intents: [
  GatewayIntentBits.Guilds  // Basic guild info only
]
```

### If You Need Additional Features:
- **Read Messages**: Add `GuildMessages` intent
- **Message Content**: Add `MessageContent` intent (requires enabling in Developer Portal)
- **Member Info**: Add `GuildMembers` intent (privileged)

### Enabling Privileged Intents:
1. Go to Discord Developer Portal ‚Üí Your Application ‚Üí Bot
2. Scroll down to "Privileged Gateway Intents"
3. Enable required intents (Message Content Intent, Server Members Intent, etc.)
4. Update the code with the corresponding `GatewayIntentBits`

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues:
1. Check Railway logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test with a different channel to isolate the issue
4. For intent errors, check that the bot code matches your Developer Portal settings
