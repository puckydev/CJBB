# Bug Fixes - Transaction Notification Issues

## Issue Reported
Transaction `b064936f452b66b8f17c8a815e2ee7b3bf112e9fdc364849a8ff08f9d4521a78` sent a notification indicating a sell of 266,146,857 $CRAWJU for 41.37 ADA, when it should have been:
1. A buy notification of 162,895 $CRAWJU for 12 ADA, OR
2. No notification at all since the bot should only send notifications for buys, not sells

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Bot Was Sending Notifications for Both Buys AND Sells
**Problem**: Line 310 in `index.js` contained:
```javascript
if (txAnalysis.amount > 0 && (txAnalysis.type === 'buy' || txAnalysis.type === 'sell'))
```

**Fix**: Changed to only send notifications for buy transactions:
```javascript
if (txAnalysis.amount > 0 && txAnalysis.type === 'buy')
```

### 2. Transaction Classification Logic Needed Improvement
**Problem**: The `analyzeTransaction` function had simplistic logic that could misclassify complex DEX transactions.

**Fix**: Enhanced the transaction analysis logic with better classification:
- Primary classification based on token flow relative to user vs DEX addresses
- Improved handling of transactions with both inputs and outputs
- Better detection of sell transactions (tokens going to DEX with no tokens to user)
- More robust buy detection (no input tokens but user receives tokens)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Notification Filtering (`index.js`)
- ✅ Now only sends notifications for BUY transactions
- ✅ Added logging for SELL transactions (but doesn't send notifications)
- ✅ Added logging for unknown transaction types
- ✅ Enhanced debugging output with transaction analysis details

### 2. Improved Transaction Analysis Logic (`index.js`)
- ✅ Better classification of buy vs sell transactions
- ✅ Improved handling of complex DEX transactions
- ✅ More accurate amount calculations
- ✅ Better detection of tokens going to DEX addresses vs user addresses

### 3. Enhanced Logging and Debugging
- ✅ Added detailed transaction analysis logging
- ✅ Created `debug_transaction.js` script for analyzing specific transactions
- ✅ Updated startup message to clarify buy-only notifications

### 4. Updated Startup Message (`index.js`)
- ✅ Clarified that only BUY transactions trigger notifications

## Testing the Fix

You can now use the debug script to analyze the problematic transaction:

```bash
node debug_transaction.js b064936f452b66b8f17c8a815e2ee7b3bf112e9fdc364849a8ff08f9d4521a78
```

This will show:
- Complete transaction analysis
- Token flow details
- Whether it would trigger a notification
- Classification reasoning

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Sell Transactions**: Will be detected and logged but NO notifications will be sent
2. **Buy Transactions**: Will trigger notifications as before
3. **Unknown Transactions**: Will be logged with detailed analysis for debugging
4. **Better Accuracy**: Improved transaction classification should reduce false positives

## Monitoring

The enhanced logging will help identify any remaining edge cases:
- All transaction analyses are now logged with detailed breakdowns
- Sell transactions are explicitly logged as "notification skipped"
- Unknown transaction types are logged for investigation

## Files Modified

1. `index.js` - Main bot logic fixes
2. `debug_transaction.js` - New debugging utility (created)
3. `BUGFIXES.md` - This documentation (created)

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated bot
2. Monitor logs for transaction classifications
3. Use the debug script if any suspicious transactions are reported
4. The enhanced logging will help identify any remaining edge cases
